I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Psychology Department at McGill University. My research takes a social-cognitive approach to studying stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination using a variety of methods including behavioural studies, computational modeling, fMRI, and eye-tracking.

I am interested in the bi-directional relationship between cognitive processes (e.g., learning and categorization) and structural factors (e.g., status hierarchies and resource inequalities). My aim is to bridge levels of analysis to discover how contexts and systems influence individual cognitions, as well as how individuals in turn perpetuate systems.

In my spare time, you can find me watching womenâ€™s soccer, reading fantasy novels, or learning how to whittle.
