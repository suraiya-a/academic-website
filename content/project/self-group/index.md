title: Intergroup decision-making under self-group conflict
summary: "In another line of research, I examine how people navigate trade-offs between what is good for themselves and what is good for their groups. Using a combination of behavioural, eye-tracking, and fMRI methodologies, I look at how typically seen patterns of intergroup bias, in which people aim to help their own groups and hurt other groups, are influenced by the degree of self-sacrifice required to make a prosocial decision. Some examples of questions this work aims to answer are:

- Do the mechanisms contributing to helping an ingroup member and helping an outgroup member become more similar when helping requires a lot of self-sacrifice? 

- How is conflict between self and other represented differently depending on whether the other is close to you (an ingroup member) or more distant from you (an outgroup member)? 

- What types of processes contribute to costly prosocial behaviour, in which someone gives up something for themself to help someone else, and how do these processes change depending on who the other person is? 

- Does helping an ingroup member rely on the same types of cognitive processes as helping an outgroup member?"
